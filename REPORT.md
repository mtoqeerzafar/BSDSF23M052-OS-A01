Feature 2 Questions:

Q1: Explain the linking rule $(TARGET): $(OBJECTS). How does it differ from linking against a library?

Answer:
$(TARGET): $(OBJECTS) is a Make rule where $(TARGET) depends on a list of object files. The recipe for this rule links those object files together into a final executable. Each object contains machine code for translation units; the linker resolves symbol references among them and produces a single binary.

Linking against a library (static .a or shared .so) differs in that you provide the linker with a library file (-lname and -L/path) instead of individual object files. For static libraries, the linker pulls only the object files from the archive that satisfy unresolved references; for shared libraries, the final executable contains references to the shared library resolved at runtime. Order of libraries on the command line matters for static linking; unresolved symbols can remain if the library is specified before the object that needs it.

Q2: What is a git tag and why is it useful? Difference between simple tag and annotated tag?

Answer:
A git tag points to a specific commit and is used to mark important points (releases) in history. A lightweight (simple) tag is just a name for a commit (like a branch that doesnâ€™t move), whereas an annotated tag is a full object that stores metadata (tagger, date, message) and can be cryptographically signed. Annotated tags are preferred for releases because they record more information and are visible in git log and git show.

Q3: Purpose of creating a "Release" on GitHub and attaching binaries?

Answer:
A GitHub Release is a user-friendly packaging of a tagged commit that allows maintainers to publish release notes and attach pre-built binaries. Attaching binaries (like bin/client) is significant because it lets users download ready-to-run artifacts without building from source â€” important for graders or end-users who donâ€™t want to compile. It also documents the exact executable associated with a release tag.


Feature 3 Questions:

1) Compare Makefile from Part 2 (multifile) and Part 3 (static)

Part 2: directly compiles all .c and links them in one step â€” no archive step. Rule was like $(TARGET): $(OBJECTS) and then $(CC) $(OBJECTS) -o $(TARGET).

Part 3: adds rules to compile .c â†’ .o, an explicit lib rule that archives the .o files into lib/libmyutils.a using ar, and the final link uses main.o plus lib/libmyutils.a. The difference: you separate creation of reusable archived binary unit, and change the link line so it uses the .a.

2)What is ar and why ranlib?

ar creates and manipulates static archive files (.a). It bundles multiple .o files into a single file.

ranlib generates an index (symbol table) inside the archive so linkers can quickly locate which object in the archive defines a required symbol. On modern GNU ar rcs often creates a table automatically, but ranlib is historically required on some systems.

3)When you run nm on client_static, are mystrlen symbols present? What does that tell you?

If mystrlen is used by the program, nm bin/client_static will show mystrlen as a defined symbol (e.g., T mystrlen). This demonstrates that static linking copied the library's object code into the executable at link time â€” there is no runtime dependency on libmyutils.a.

Include small outputs (e.g., ar -t and nm snippets) and a short paragraph interpreting them.


Feature 4 Questions :

Q1 â€” What is Position-Independent Code (-fPIC) and why required?
-fPIC instructs the compiler to produce machine code that does not assume it will be loaded at a fixed absolute address. PIC uses relative addressing through GOT/PLT so the same compiled code can be mapped at different addresses in different processes. Shared libraries are loaded into arbitrary addresses by the OS loader (to allow address space layout randomization and sharing), therefore object files used to produce .so must be position-independent so relocation is safe and efficient.

Q2 â€” Explain file size difference between static and dynamic clients.
A statically-linked executable includes the library code copied from the .a into the final binary at link time, so the executable contains all used library functions â€” increasing its size. A dynamically-linked executable contains only references (DT_NEEDED entries) to the shared library; the actual code lives in .so and is loaded at runtime. Therefore client_static is larger; client_dynamic is smaller. Additionally, multiple processes using the same .so share a single memory copy.

Q3 â€” What is LD_LIBRARY_PATH and why necessary?
LD_LIBRARY_PATH is an environment variable used by the dynamic loader to locate shared libraries at runtime before searching system default locations (/lib, /usr/lib) or RPATH. Since lib/libmyutils.so lives in the project directory (not a system path), the loader cannot find it by default, so we set LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$(pwd)/lib so the dynamic loader knows where to look. This demonstrates that the loader is responsible for locating shared libraries at program start and will only succeed if libraries are in its search paths or have an embedded runpath.

Feature 5 Questions :

What is Position-Independent Code (-fPIC)?

Already answered in Feature-4.

ðŸ”¹ Difference in file size between static and dynamic clients?

Already explained.

ðŸ”¹ What is LD_LIBRARY_PATH?

Already explained.

ðŸ”¹ Why are man pages important?

â†’ They provide standardized documentation for commands and libraries, accessible directly through the man command.
â†’ Man pages ensure that users and developers can quickly learn how to use your program, its options, and its purpose without searching external docs.
â†’ They follow a consistent sectioned format (NAME, SYNOPSIS, DESCRIPTION, AUTHOR, etc.), making them easy to read and universally understood in Unix/Linux systems.

ðŸ”¹ What does the install target simulate?

â†’ It simulates a system-wide installation, where:

The executable is copied to /usr/local/bin, so it can be run from anywhere by just typing client.

The man page is copied to /usr/local/share/man/man1, so users can access documentation with man client.
